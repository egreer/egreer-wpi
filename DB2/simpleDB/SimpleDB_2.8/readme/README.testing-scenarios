TESTING SCENARIOS

These testing scenarios were each designed to test a particular condition in
the Wait-Die policy that can occur in the code that should be checked. These 
test scenarios were show as complete coverage of the possible conditions by 
the Eclipse plug-in EclEmma. EclEmma measures code coverage of tests to 
ensure that they are executing each line of code. By verifying the expected 
results versus the actual results we can see if the code is executing correctly

1) See if an older TX will wait for an xLock on a sLock block
tx2(blk1, shared)
tx2(blk1, exclusive) //waits

|2) TX has xLock, but now only needs sLock
tx5(blk3, exclusive)
tx5(blk3, shared)

|3) See if an older TX will wait for an xLock on a xLock block
tx2(blk, exclusive)
tx1(blk, exclusive) //waits

|4) TX has exclusive rights to share lock and needs to update to xLock 
tx5(blk4, shared)
tx5(blk4, exclusive)

5) TX has a sLock and needs to update to xLock, and is older then everything else waiting
tx1(blk, shared)
tx2(blk, shared)
tx1(blk, exclusive) //waits

|6) TX has a sLock and needs to update to xLock, and is younger someone else waiting
tx6(blk6, shared)
tx7(blk6, shared)
tx7(blk6, exclusive) //dies

|7) TX wants a sLock but someone has xLock, TX is older
tx3(blk, exclusive)
tx2(blk, shared) //waits

|8) TX	 wants a sLock but someone has xLock, TX is younger
tx6(blk7, exclusive)
tx7(blk7, shared) //dies

|9) TX wants a sLock and someone else has a sLock
tx2(blk, shared)
tx3(blk, shared)

|10) TX wants a sLock and no one has a lock
tx5(blk4, shared)

|11) TX wants a xLock and no one has a lock
tx5(blk3, exclusive)
