This is an EXTENDED case study.

It is the largest program you have seen so far. However, it uses only the concepts
that we have presented in class. While you may look at this and think "I could never
do that", my answer is that you will learn to do so in time. All it takes is patience,
discipline, and good programming practice.

Now that this set of classes has been written, I need to provide meaningful test cases
to validate that each of the sub-functionalities I introduced will work.

If you check out the UniversityDatabaseTest test case, it just runs the code on the 
given example, but there is a distinct need to validate the independent proper working
of all sub-parts.
